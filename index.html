	  <h3>Hi, I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>. I have successfully demonstrated during last decade my ability to design, develop and maintain complex mobile apps with clean architecture which are used by millions of users. Apart from working at Meerkat app, I have worked on over 10 published Android apps including app which ranked in top 10 in the UK (Stagecoach Bus app currently ranked 9th in Map and Navigation section in the UK), app which is highly rated in the play store (TopCashback UK app 4.5/5 based on over 16K reviews) and app which won award (Gone For Good app won Best not for profit award at Big Chip Awards 2016). Currently I work as Senior Software Engineer at the mobile platform team in <a href="https://www.comparethemarket.com/">comparethemarket.com</a> where I'm leading the work of designing and developing Android libraries written in Kotlin. Also helping Android Experience team integrating those libraries into Meerkat Android app. I have also worked on improving CI/CD workflows, test automation coverage, documentation etc.
