I have been working with both .Net and Android for about 5 years now. I was asked quite a few times: which platform easier to develop - Android or .Net?

It was Android which got me first interested in programming. When I got my first smartphone, I wondered how much time it takes to build a simple app like a calculator. After some research, I made my plan to learn Android and Java. Eventually I made my 'Hello World' app which gave me enough confidence to apply for a Computer Science course to deepen my knowledge in programming.

 
While I was doing research on Android/Java stuff, I came across Microsoft Virtual Academy (MVA). I really liked that Microsoft teaching you different technology for free. I started doing .Net related courses in MVA and eventually I reached the highest level of membership in MVA - Platinum membership and now I am member of MVA founders club. 

In my first job as full-time software developer, I was working on both .Net and Android development. Initially mostly on Asp.net MVC projects using Visual Studio. I was really amazed how easier it was developing in Visual Studio compared to Eclipse which I was using for Android at that time. .Net ecosystem has matured over the years with tons of useful libraries. Although MVC was new compared to WinForm, I really loved it and never regretted that I did not get much commercial experience in WinForm. Tools like Resharper made my life a lot easier as a developer. Infact one point of time, I started prefering .Net development over Android development. 

It was just a few months and when I finally came back to Android to do an interesting client project, I was amazed how quickly things have changed in Android world. Android Studio and Gradle was replacing the Eclipse. Google has introduced the Material Design which was big change since for the first time you have to think like a designer to be a good developer. I must say it was a steep learning curve for me even with some experience in Android to get used to all these changes. But it was time worth spend as even now I am using those tools in my present job as a Mobile developer. I still do .Net work but it is less than 10% of my time. My company's mobile backend is in .Net and there I have to work from time to time. But whenever I go back to do my .Net work it doesn't feel like I have missed something. Things doesn't change much in .Net world whereas in Android world every year there will be something which will need some time and efforts to get used to. Google keeps expanding the already complex API (e.g. fragments, Wear, and Auto). Google also adds new components that are very similar to existing ones (e.g. RecyclerView). And then there is the core vs support differences and the support libraries are very poorly documented (e.g. MediaBrowserServiceCompat). Android community is also very active which have been busy developing complex but useful libraries (e.g. Dagger2, RxJava2). All of this makes keeping up-to-date with Android environment difficult for even experienced developer. I can imagine how difficult it will be for somebody to start developing for Android. In my company, all placement developers start in .Net development and after a few weeks of training they can work on production code whereas I doubt it that it will be the same for them to get used to Android/iOS code.
