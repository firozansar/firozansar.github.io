      <p>Although I started as a mid-senior Software Engineer, I have just recently been promoted to Senior Software
        Engineer. At CtM, apart from writing high quality code I am involved in code reviews, meetings (stand-up, sprint
        planning, retrospectives), documentation. I have actively collaborated with other engineers, designers, product
        managers and SDETs to make sure that the features/ bug fixes I deliver are robust and work as intended. To point
        out a few of my contributions:
      <ul>
        <li>I have worked on some interesting functionalities implementing Firebase remote config, push notifications,
          Google map displaying Restaurant information, processing data from GraphQL endpoints etc. Currently I am
          working on the UserSession library module which encapsulates all the functionality related to the user and its
          identification, authorization, and authentication.</li>
        <li>I have documented Android TechRadar which keeps track of the versions of different libraries and tools we use
          for development of the Meerkat Android App.</li>
        <li>I have utilised my expertise in CI/CD to improve Bitrise workflow for Meerkat Android app. I have optimised the
        workflow by removing redundant workflows and also suggested ways to reduce build times.</li>
        <li>I have paired with SDETs in finding a solution for setting up Appium for UI Flow testing in Android. I suggested
          ways to set up runtime mocking for Appium testing.</li>
        <li>On several occasions I have collaborated effectively with iOS engineers, backend engineers and product managers.
        For example, implementation of contract testing, identifying and fixing production issues etc.</li>
        <li>I volunteered to do innovation work with the Observability team to evaluate APM tools and find a replacement for
        Splunk.</li>
        <li>I have also given a presentation in the Android Guild meeting on several topics like app performance
          benchmarking, Android TechRadar etc.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Android Tech Lead / Senior Software Engineer</h3>
        <span>
          <h4>Stagecoach Group Plc</h4><time>October 2018 to November 2020</time>
        </span>
      </header>
      <p>As Android Tech Lead, I managed and mentored a team of developers while working hands-on. Apart from
        maintaining and adding functionalities to existing Stagecoach apps (Stagecoach UK Bus app, Oxford Tube app
        etc.), I contributed to the vision and long-term technical strategy. The UK Bus app is currently downloaded more
        than a million times and ranked 13th in the Google Play UK maps and navigation category (Oct, 2020). My most
        notable contribution to the app was the implementation of a live map displaying real time bus movement feature
        in the current Stagecoach Bus Android app. During COVID-19 crisis, I implemented "busy bus" functionality which
        helped customers visualise how busy a bus was for social distancing purposes. Another notable contribution of
        mine was the Google Pay integration in the app during the Google Pay event at Google London office where I also
        did a technical presentation on it.</p>
