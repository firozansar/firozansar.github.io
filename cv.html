            <p>Although I started as a mid-senior Software Engineer, I got promoted to Senior Software Engineer. Currently
              I'm leading the work of designing and developing Android libraries written in Kotlin in the platform team. For
              example, I worked on the User-Session library module which encapsulates all the functionality related to the
              CTM app users and their identification, authorization, and authentication. I have also helped the Android
              Experience team integrate those libraries into the Meerkat Android app. My other notable work in the platform
              team includes working on improving/automating CI/CD workflows, increasing test automation coverage, writing
              and publishing documentation (using Dokka) etc. Apart from writing high quality code, I have also been
              involved in code reviews, meetings (stand-up, sprint planning, retrospectives). I have actively collaborated
              with other engineers, designers, product managers and SDETs to make sure that the features/ bug fixes I
              deliver are robust and work as intended.

            <p>As Android Tech Lead, I managed and mentored a team of developers while working hands-on. Apart from
              maintaining and adding functionalities to existing Stagecoach apps (Stagecoach UK Bus app, Oxford Tube app
              etc.), I contributed to the vision and long-term technical strategy. The UK Bus app is currently downloaded more
              than a million times and ranked 13th in the Google Play UK maps and navigation category (Oct, 2020). My most
              notable contribution to the app was the implementation of a live map displaying real time bus movement feature
              in the current Stagecoach Bus Android app. During COVID-19 crisis, I implemented "busy bus" functionality which
              helped customers visualise how busy a bus was for social distancing purposes. Another notable contribution of
              mine was the Google Pay integration in the app during the Google Pay event at Google London office where I also
              did a technical presentation on it.</p>
