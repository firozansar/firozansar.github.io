          <h3>Android Tech Lead / Senior Software Engineer</h3>
          <span><address>Stagecoach Group Plc</address><time>October 2018 to November 2020</time></span>
      </header>
      <p>As Android Tech Lead, I managed and mentored a team of developers while working hands-on. Apart from maintaining and adding functionalities to existing Stagecoach apps (Stagecoach UK Bus app, Oxford Tube app etc.), I contributed to the vision and long-term technical strategy. The UK Bus app is currently downloaded more than a million times and ranked 13th in the Google Play UK maps and navigation category (Oct, 2020). My most notable contribution to the app was the implementation of a live map displaying real time bus movement feature in the current Stagecoach Bus Android app. During COVID-19 crisis, I implemented "busy bus" functionality which helped customers visualise how busy a bus was for social distancing purposes. Another notable contribution of mine was the Google Pay integration in the app during the Google Pay event at Google London office where I also did a technical presentation on it.</p>
