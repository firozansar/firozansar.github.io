<div class="details">
	I am a software developer with a Computer Science Engineering degree from Ohio State University. I graduated in 2008, but have been playing with code ever since I was young. I view code as a brain teaser puzzle and find it very rewarding to figure something out. Learning new ways of doing things keeps me very excited and interested in programming. I write code because it is my passion and am lucky that it is also my career.

When I'm not writing code I love to be outdoors. Mountain biking is one of my favorite outdoor hobbies and I love working on my bike almost as much as riding. I also love hiking, camping, photography, and anything else that gets me outside.
